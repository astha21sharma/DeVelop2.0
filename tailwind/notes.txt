there are many key features of  using tailwind:

SIZE VARIES
1)sm-small
2.md-middle// refer site

CREATING BUTTON
<body>
<div class=">
  <button class="text-sm px-4 py-4 bg-purple-399 text-white rounded-md hover:bg-pink-880(MENTION HOVER)>

  focus state and active state:
  focus: the state where the element is currently selected to receive input files
  active :represent the state where the element is currently being activated by user

APPLY DERECTIVE
this can be used at time when u want to do a repetitive task at an ease
by just spcifing any userdefined class

.btn{
   @apply  text-sm px-4 py-4 bg-purple-399 text-white rounded-md hover:bg-pink-880(MENTION HOVER);
}//note:this would be written in styles.css


IN THIS WAY WHEREEVER U USE THE CLASS SAME REPLICA WOULD BE CREATED--------------AND IF I WANT to add some change just after using the userdefined one i can write it

//ORDER IN Tailwind PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART
FOR EX;if u want the tailwind utilities to be covering ur user defined value...u muat keep it in betwen components and  utilities

//LAYER DERECTIVES
//OVERWRITE A PARTICULAR LAYER
